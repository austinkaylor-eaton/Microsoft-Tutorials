# Build your first Orleans app with ASP.NET Core
> Back to [Solution README](../README.md)

## About
This tutorial is a follow-along of the [Quickstart: Build your first Orleans app with ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/quickstarts/build-your-first-orleans-app?tabs=visual-studio) tutorial on Microsoft Learn.
In this tutorial, you use Orleans and ASP.NET Core 8.0 Minimal APIs to build a URL shortener app. 

Users submit a full URL to the app's /shorten endpoint and get a shortened version to share with others, who are redirected to the original site. The app uses Orleans grains and silos to manage state in a distributed manner to allow for scalability and resiliency.

## Objectives
- Learn how to add Orleans to an ASP.NET Core app
- Learn how to work with grains and silos
- Learn how to configure state management
- Learn how to integrate Orleans with API endpoints
